							<h3 class="hdng-caps-md-blue-3">Community Impact</h3>
						</div>
						<p class="sans-serif-sm-grey">Charles Ellington, father of Rob Ellington, has had a large impact on the community of Victoria. From his humble upbringing 
						in an orphanage he worked hard to earn a successful career as a Notary Public. Not resting on the laurels of his success, Charles gave back to the community 
						in a number if philanthropical endeavours. Charles would spend 25 years on the board of the British Columbia Prostestant Orphans Home, including 5 years as 
						board chair. From his time there he became a founding chair of the board of the Cridge Centre for the Family. Charles aided in the transition of the Centre 
						from the now outdated role of an Orphanage to a facility designed for the housing and service of single parents. This included child day care and in time housing
						for senior citizens.</p>
